# Netwaiter

Netwaiter is a CLI utility used to wait for a network resource (URL, host:port)
to become available.

The utility is a single binary with no dependencies so that it is easy to
include in various workflows.  It is meant to replace script-based logic, often
using different tools like curl or netcat, to test whether a network resource is
available.
